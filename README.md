# Linux Serial Port Programming Tutorial using C Language and termios API

- In this repo ,You will find code for programming the serial port of your Linux distribution(Ubuntu,Fedora,Arch,Linux Mint) using C language.
- We will also Learn to perform Bi-Directional Serial Communication between a Linux PC and an Arduino UNO
- Here we will be using the native API's provided by the Linux System like the
  - **termios** structure.
  - **read()** system call
  - **write()** system call
-  to configure the serial port of our linux system.
-  Code is written in **Pure C** language and compiled using **GCC**.

 The above image shows how to interface bare microcontrollers like 8051,ATmega328P,MSP430 with linux serial port using a [USB to Serial Converter](https://www.xanthium.in/USB-to-Serial-RS232-RS485-Converter).

## Compiling the Code.

The Code can be compiled using GCC on any modern Linux Systems.
